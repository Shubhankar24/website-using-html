            <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It
                was
                mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of the
                C
                language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features
                make C
                language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development</p>

                has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows,
                Linux,
                Unix, Mac etc.</p>

            <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                emphasizes code
                readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its
                object-oriented
                approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects</p>

            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
                platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically
                compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                computer architecture.</p>

                typing,

            </div>
            <p>Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with
                type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's
                standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more
                concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web
                applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic
                with Android apps. Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation
                protects the Kotlin trademark</p>

            <p>Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob
                Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage
                collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as
                Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go</p>
